# 🔍 Key Business Insights

## 1. Pricing Strategy Gaps
- ADR remains largely flat across May–July, even during weekends and holidays.
- No evidence of **dynamic pricing** or **weekday/weekend-based rate adjustments**, which are industry best practices.

> 📌 Recommendation: Adopt a **dynamic pricing model** to reflect demand peaks and weekend inflows.


## 2. Realisation Rates
- Hotels are experiencing **lower realisation** (URN/BRN), especially on OTA platforms (Online Travel Agencies).
- No-show and cancellation rates increase for bookings via third-party platforms.

> 📌 Recommendation: Improve realization by incentivizing direct bookings and penalizing no-shows.


## 3. Channel Performance

- **Offline channels** have higher ADRs but fewer bookings.
- **OTAs dominate** in terms of volume but offer lower revenue per room.

> 📌 Recommendation: Use **promotional campaigns** and loyalty points to boost direct bookings.


## 4. Revenue & Occupancy Trends
- Bangalore and Hyderabad properties show relatively better occupancy, but revenue doesn't scale accordingly.
- Revenue stagnates despite steady bookings, indicating possible **revenue leakage**.

> 📌 Recommendation: Implement **value-added upselling** (meals, upgrades) to increase revenue per guest.


## 5. Room Category Preferences
- Standard and Elite rooms are most booked; Premium and Presidential rooms underperform.

> 📌 Recommendation: Repackage higher-end rooms with discount bundles or convert to more in-demand room types.


## 6. Day-Type Pricing Missed
- Day-type (Weekday vs. Weekend) does not influence ADR or bookings, indicating no pricing optimization by day.

> 📌 Recommendation: Introduce **weekend surge pricing** and weekday discount schemes.
